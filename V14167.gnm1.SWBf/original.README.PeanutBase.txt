Initial notes:
March 15, 2014

Files in this directory include the scaffold assemblies for Arachis duranensis
(Adur1.split5.fa.gz), and the pseudomolecule assemblies, version 1.0 for the
genome. The intact pseudomolecules plus the remaining scaffolds are in
the fasta file Aradu_v1.0.20140819.fa.gz .

By using these files, you or a collaborator have accepted the Usage Agreement
(usage_agreement.txt) accompanying these files.

Directory legend:
  RM - RepeatMask-ed, using Arachis repeats provided by David Bertioli et al.
  
  by_scaff - The pseudomolecule sequences are in multifasta format, in scaffold
  chunks. Definition lines give scaffold name and orientation.
  
  Not marked "by_scaff" - these pseudomolecule sequences are "entire", with a
  single definition line at the top, e.g. >Aradu.A01.

In the "entire" versions (not marked "by_scaff"), the scaffold sequences have
been concatenated (after ordering and orienting), separated by spacer sequences
of 10,000 "n"s.

NOTE added May 20, 2014: the scaffold file Adur1.split4.fa has been replaced with
an updated file Adur1.split5.fa to reflect the scaffolds used in the 1.0 assemblies.
The earlier file contained some "split" scaffolds with different split locations
than in the final assembly.

---------
NOTE added August 24, 2014: the following saffolds were found to be present
in both the pseudomolecule assemblies and in the files of unplaced scaffolds
(Aradu.A_unplaced and Aradu.A_unplaced_RM):
    Adur78_2
    Adur188_2
    Adur356_2
    Adur104_4
    Adur18_2
    Adur227_2
    Adur147_2
    Adur1_2
    Adur160_2
    Adur66_3
    Adur101_2
These redundant scaffolds are removed from Aradu.A_unplaced and Aradu.A_unplaced_RM 
in the 2014-08-20 version of these two files.

An additional set of 182 very poor-quality scffolds were removed from the 2014-08-24 version.
These scaffolds had no predicted gene models, and < 2000 nt of [ATCG] or > 80% Ns.

File Aradu_v1.0_20140908.fa contains only the scaffolds used in the main assembly (i.e.
pseudomolecules and unplaced scaffolds).


---------
NOTE added July 13, 2015: 
The following "split" saffolds were found to be redundant in the 
"all scaffolds" file, Adur1.split5.fa. These were not used in the pseudomolecule assembly,
and so have been removed from a patched "all scaffolds" file, Adur1.split6.fa : 
  Adur1_3 Adur101_3 Adur104_6 Adur119_4 Adur12_4 Adur120_3 Adur127_3 Adur1291_3
